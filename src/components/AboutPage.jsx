        <p>
            IMBAD "I'M BAD" is a team of five talented and determined women who are Pursuit fellows, training to become full-stack software developers. 
            Together we are utilizing the React skills we have learned thus far to create a "Youtube Clone" application. Using YouTube's API, we're crafting a platform that allows users to seamlessly explore, search, and play YouTube videos directly on our application. 
            As we navigate the intricacies of integrating APIs and refining user interfaces, we're building a space that mirrors the functionality of the renowned YouTube platform.
